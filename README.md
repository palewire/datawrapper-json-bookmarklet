# Datawrapper JSON bookmarklet

A bookmarklet for quickly accessing the JSON configuration of your Datawrapper chart

## Why would I want this?

When automating the creation of Datawrapper charts via the service's API, it's not always obvious which backend setting correpond to a style and behavior on a chart's frontend.

To better understand how a chart is put together, it can be helpful to review the configuration options generated by the site's point-and-click interface.

This bookmarklet will jump you directly from a chart's editing panel to a URL that hosts the JSON configuration of the current chart.

## Getting started

There are two methods for installing the bookmarklet.

### 1. Drag and drop

Drag the link below into your brower's bookmark bar:

<a href="javascript:(function() { var url = window.location.href; var id = url.split('/')[4]; window.open('https://app.datawrapper.de/api/v3/collaboration/charts/' + id, '_blank') })();">Datawrapper JSON</a>

### 2. Paste code

Create a new bookmark in your browser and paste in the following code:

```js
javascript:(function() { var url = window.location.href; var id = url.split('/')[4]; window.open('https://app.datawrapper.de/api/v3/collaboration/charts/' + id, '_blank') })();
```

Add the bookmarklet to your browser's bookmarks bar.

## Usage

Visit the editing panel of a Datawrapper chart inside of your account. It will have a URL like XXX
